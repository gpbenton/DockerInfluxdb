# DockerInfluxdb
Creates a docker container from Influxdb Source files

I was repurposing a 386 based PC, and wanted to run Influxdb to store history for my home automation sensors.

InfluxData don't supply packages for 386, and building from source was challenging.  So I learned some Docker by converting the 386 binary files InfluxData do supply into a docker image.
